In January 2020 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-48854450) empty businesses costed UK taxpayers £1bn a year, prompting calls for urgent reform of the system.

Some councils lose out on millions of pounds of potential business rates income through a tax relief on empty properties, BBC analysis shows.

A local authority mayor in northern England said the money "added up to a lot" and the system was unfair.

The Treasury said it would announce a review of business rates "in due course".

Experts say the current system pits local authorities - which want stable income - against businesses.

The Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association. Stories generated by the partnership included:
